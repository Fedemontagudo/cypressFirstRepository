# cypressFirstRepository

This is the first public Cypress Repository I upload to GitHub. Currently, the biggest part of my achievements using this tool are privates and on my company repositories, so basically i'm gona use this repo for creation of new custm commands and try testing strategies.

On the future, i wish it could became something bigger, where i have stored part of my day-to-day tools and tricks.
